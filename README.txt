Project is about apartment rentals.

I have created 3 models: Apartments, Tenants and Rent.

For listing apartments, please use > /apartments/apartments-list/
For listing tenants, please use > /tenants/tenants-list/
For listing rents, please use > /rentals/rentals-list/
For creating apartments, please use > /apartments/apartment-create/
For creating tenants, please use > /tenants/tenant-create/
For creating rents, please use > /rentals/rent-create/

I have included Inheritance also, you may check templates/base.html and later:
- templates/apartments/
- templates/rentals/
- templates/tenants/

At the navbar, I have included a search form for searching Apartments on door number field.
