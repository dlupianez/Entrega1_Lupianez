Name: David Lupianez

Project is about apartment rentals.

I have created 4 apps: Apartments, Tenants, Rentals and Users.

Project is about apartment rentals, so applications need to be able to handle apartments, tenants and rental objects, and their relationships.

I have also included a calculated field for the Apartment model.

I have included Template Inheritance also, you may check templates/base.html and later:
- templates/apartments/
- templates/rentals/
- templates/tenants/

At the navbar, I have included a search form for searching Apartments on door number field.

Please find the demo video here > media/Entrega1_Lupianez_06022023.mkv

Also I have uploaded the video to python anywhere server here >
